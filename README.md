# Machine-Learning-to-predict-the-Pima-Indian-heritage-Dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. As such it is a classification problem. It is a good dataset for demonstration because all of the input attributes are numeric and the output variable to be predicted is binary (0 or 1).
